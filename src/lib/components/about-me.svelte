    <Paragraph>
      I have experience with the development of high performant web applications. My role as a
      frontend engineer at Passbase was to develop and take ownership of a diverse range of
      applications written in React, Next.js and GraphQL. Including the development of a Web-SDK for
      identity verification. Further applications I worked on include an customer dashboard and
      internal dashboard for managing identity verifications.

      After I left Passbase I founded <Link href="https://lettranslate.com/">lettranslate.com</Link>
      a translation management tool. The stack I used for this project included SvelteKit, Prisma ORM
      (with PostgreSQL), GraphQL, Node.js and TypeScript.

      Before my job at Passbase I have gained professional experience working for QuestionPro, a
      provider for survey feedback management systems. In particular, I have worked on a new
      prototype for a dashboard that allows the user to monitor ongoing surveys. I designed the
      complete project by myself including the backend, database and frontend using Angular, MongoDB
      and Node.js. Although I already knew those technologies from multiple personal projects, I
      could greatly improve during my internship in an autonomous manner.
